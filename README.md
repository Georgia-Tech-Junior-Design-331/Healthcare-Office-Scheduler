# Healthcare-Office-Scheduler
GT Junior Design Team 331's project.
We are building a scheduler for health offices to manage and communicate with their patients.

# Code Review Manifest
First, switch to the **sprint4 branch**, which has our latest work.

We reccomend that you **review the web/office folder** and its possibly its direct dependencies in the **modules folder** (excluding the examples folder). This contains our frontend code for the office side of our application, which allows health office workers to create and manage appointments and patients. Each subfolder contains the code for a specific page. We are using HTML, Javascript, and React.
